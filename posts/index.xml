      <description>A long time ago, I was playing around with randomizers in Ableton. I finally decided to take a look at the project again and came up with this fun little song. Something refreshing now that it&amp;rsquo;s properly summer. :)

      <description>I found an old practice project and thought, what if this, but also Xion, and also shoegaze-y metal? And so, this happened. It also happened to be the 20th anniversary of Kingdom Hearts this year, and the summer on top of that, so it&amp;rsquo;s extra fitting.

      <description>The second in my &amp;ldquo;series&amp;rdquo; revisiting one-off things I&amp;rsquo;ve played. This piece depicts an encounter between the party and some kind of foe—but are they really a foe? Why do they seem to know one of you? Between bouts, a conflictedness begins to grow. Listen below!

      <title>TGDNE series (2/?): Are you sure this spaceship is abandoned?</title>

      <description>This is the second track in my &amp;ldquo;This Game Does Not Exist&amp;rdquo; collection, and also the first of my &amp;ldquo;morning sprints&amp;rdquo;, where I try to spend an hour in the morning developing some new idea. Of course, the polishing took longer than an hour, but all in all, this is more of a proof-of-concept than what I would call a full-fledged track: A quick idea to get something out there (which is what matters)!</description>

      <description>This was orignally meant to be my submission for a course on video game music I took on the side this semester. I ended up getting to do a collaboration with a great dev team and produce music for an actual game, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to abandon this one. So, it gets to be the first entry in my &amp;ldquo;This Game Does Not Exist&amp;rdquo; collection of game-inspired but as yet un-play-tested music!</description>

      <description>This (mini- (mini-)) mini-album is the result of a collaboration with NoShotStudios, who developed the puzzle platformer No Splotch Gallery. Check out the game!
The developers asked for a couple of classical-inspired tracks to fit the museum gallery setting, and they turned out to be really fun to make! You can listen below.

      <title>Improvisation series (1/?): The Haven</title>

      <description>To practice coming back to ideas, I&amp;rsquo;m trying to build a habit of revisiting the things I happen to improvise while bored (or procrastinating) and clean them up a bit. &amp;ldquo;Vignette: The Haven,&amp;rdquo; the first in this series, depicts a place of rest—a city or town, perhaps—but hints at tensions building in the background, a dark past.

      <description>This was the first thing I seriously made in Ableton. I&amp;rsquo;ve fiddled around with it a bit since I first finished it, but I mostly haven&amp;rsquo;t changed it from how it was at the time. My coffee scale broke on the day I started working on this, then somehow fixed itself on the day I finished it, hence the title! Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s not any deeper than that.
