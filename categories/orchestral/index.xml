      <description>This is the second track in my &amp;ldquo;This Game Does Not Exist&amp;rdquo; collection, and also the first of my &amp;ldquo;morning sprints&amp;rdquo;, where I try to spend an hour in the morning developing some new idea. Of course, the polishing took longer than an hour, but all in all, this is more of a proof-of-concept than what I would call a full-fledged track: A quick idea to get something out there (which is what matters)!</description>

      <description>This was orignally meant to be my submission for a course on video game music I took on the side this semester. I ended up getting to do a collaboration with a great dev team and produce music for an actual game, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to abandon this one. So, it gets to be the first entry in my &amp;ldquo;This Game Does Not Exist&amp;rdquo; collection of game-inspired but as yet un-play-tested music!</description>

      <description>This (mini- (mini-)) mini-album is the result of a collaboration with NoShotStudios, who developed the puzzle platformer No Splotch Gallery. Check out the game!
The developers asked for a couple of classical-inspired tracks to fit the museum gallery setting, and they turned out to be really fun to make! You can listen below.
