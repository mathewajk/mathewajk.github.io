      <description>The second in my &amp;ldquo;series&amp;rdquo; revisiting one-off things I&amp;rsquo;ve played. This piece depicts an encounter between the party and some kind of foe—but are they really a foe? Why do they seem to know one of you? Between bouts, a conflictedness begins to grow. Listen below!

      <description>This was orignally meant to be my submission for a course on video game music I took on the side this semester. I ended up getting to do a collaboration with a great dev team and produce music for an actual game, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to abandon this one. So, it gets to be the first entry in my &amp;ldquo;This Game Does Not Exist&amp;rdquo; collection of game-inspired but as yet un-play-tested music!</description>

      <description>To practice coming back to ideas, I&amp;rsquo;m trying to build a habit of revisiting the things I happen to improvise while bored (or procrastinating) and clean them up a bit. &amp;ldquo;Vignette: The Haven,&amp;rdquo; the first in this series, depicts a place of rest—a city or town, perhaps—but hints at tensions building in the background, a dark past.
