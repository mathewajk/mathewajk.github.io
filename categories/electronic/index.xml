      <description>A long time ago, I was playing around with randomizers in Ableton. I finally decided to take a look at the project again and came up with this fun little song. Something refreshing now that it&amp;rsquo;s properly summer. :)

      <description>I found an old practice project and thought, what if this, but also Xion, and also shoegaze-y metal? And so, this happened. It also happened to be the 20th anniversary of Kingdom Hearts this year, and the summer on top of that, so it&amp;rsquo;s extra fitting.

      <description>This is the second track in my &amp;ldquo;This Game Does Not Exist&amp;rdquo; collection, and also the first of my &amp;ldquo;morning sprints&amp;rdquo;, where I try to spend an hour in the morning developing some new idea. Of course, the polishing took longer than an hour, but all in all, this is more of a proof-of-concept than what I would call a full-fledged track: A quick idea to get something out there (which is what matters)!</description>

      <description>This was the first thing I seriously made in Ableton. I&amp;rsquo;ve fiddled around with it a bit since I first finished it, but I mostly haven&amp;rsquo;t changed it from how it was at the time. My coffee scale broke on the day I started working on this, then somehow fixed itself on the day I finished it, hence the title! Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s not any deeper than that.
