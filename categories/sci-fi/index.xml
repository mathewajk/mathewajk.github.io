      <description>This is the second track in my &amp;ldquo;This Game Does Not Exist&amp;rdquo; collection, and also the first of my &amp;ldquo;morning sprints&amp;rdquo;, where I try to spend an hour in the morning developing some new idea. Of course, the polishing took longer than an hour, but all in all, this is more of a proof-of-concept than what I would call a full-fledged track: A quick idea to get something out there (which is what matters)!</description>
