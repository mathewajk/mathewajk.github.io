      <description>This was the first thing I seriously made in Ableton. I&amp;rsquo;ve fiddled around with it a bit since I first finished it, but I mostly haven&amp;rsquo;t changed it from how it was at the time. My coffee scale broke on the day I started working on this, then somehow fixed itself on the day I finished it, hence the title! Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s not any deeper than that.
